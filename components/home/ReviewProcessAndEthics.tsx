                            The double-blind peer-review process will be adopted for IC-AIA 2026, organised by Kalindi College, University of Delhi to ensure the highest standards of academic integrity, fairness, and objectivity. In this system, both the authors and reviewers remain anonymous throughout the evaluation process. This structure eliminates potential biases related to identity, institution, nationality, seniority or reputation.

                            Upon submission, each manuscript undergoes an initial editorial screening to verify relevance to conference themes, compliance with formatting guidelines, and originality using plagiarism-detection tools. Submissions that pass this stage are assigned to two or more expert reviewers who possess specialised domain knowledge.

                        <p>Reviewers assess the manuscript based on:</p>

                            Author identities are not disclosed to reviewers, and reviewers&apos; identities remain concealed from authors. Revised manuscripts undergo further scrutiny until they meet scientific and ethical standards. Only papers that successfully pass this rigorous double-blind process are considered for publication and may be forwarded to partnering publication outlets, including CRC&apos;s prestigious imprint under CRC Press, subject to final approval.
